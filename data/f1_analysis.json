    "description": "Mercedes and Ferrari have revealed an identical secret on their 2026 F1 cars. During shakedown runs, both the Mercedes W17 and Ferrari SF-26 were spotted with a mysterious hole in the diffuser. This is no coincidence—it's the first major clue to F1's new aerodynamic era.\n\nWith the 2026 regulations banning complex ground-effect floors, teams have lost massive downforce. This hole is a critical innovation to recover it. We break down how this trick works:\n🔧 Why the hole exists: To replace lost ai",
